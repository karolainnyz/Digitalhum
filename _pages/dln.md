#GPT-5 mini Reflection: Digital Literacy from My Perspective

I am a 19-year-old university student majoring in Hospitality and minoring in Nutrition. Digital literacy for me is practical and social as much as it is academic. I use digital tools every day to plan menus, schedule events, collect dietary information, and communicate with classmates and instructors. On top of those task-driven uses, I am learning to see digital literacy as a set of habits and critical lenses that shape how I create content, manage data, and collaborate across disciplines.

For content creation I rely on straightforward, reproducible strategies: draft ideas in Google Docs for real-time collaboration; create visual menus and short promotional posts with Canva; and record short video demonstrations on my phone for Instagram Reels and TikTok. I think about accessibility—clear captions, high-contrast images, and simple language—because hospitality aims to serve diverse people. I already use templates and version control (simple file naming and Google Drive folders) so I can return to previous menus or diet plans without losing context. I am comfortable using social platforms for outreach, but I am becoming more deliberate about audience, tone, and the ethics of sharing personal or client information.

Social interaction online is a mix of formal and informal practice. For class group work we use Microsoft Teams or Slack for organizing tasks and Zoom for meetings. Informally, I use WhatsApp groups to coordinate shifts or study sessions. I try to practice clear digital etiquette: setting expectations for response times, using threaded conversations for different topics, and summarizing decisions in a shared document. Those small routines reduce friction and help our interdisciplinary teams—where members might be coming from Computer Science, Film and New Media, Environmental Studies, or Creative Writing—stay aligned.

For research and data management I am learning basic but powerful tools. I use Google Drive and OneDrive for file storage and collaborative notes, and Zotero or Mendeley for collecting references when I read nutrition studies or hospitality case reports. For simple data manipulation I rely on Google Sheets and Excel: cleaning lists, calculating budgets, and making pivot tables to summarize guest preferences. When I need more robust analysis, I collaborate with classmates who know R or Python; they help turn raw check-in logs, survey responses, or ingredient lists into visualizations and summary statistics. I have also started exploring simple qualitative tools like NVivo or Dedoose for categorizing interview notes about guest experiences.

Being in a room with students from CS, Interactive Media, Film, Engineering, and the humanities has broadened my sense of what digital humanities can offer my field. Digital storytelling techniques from Film and New Media help me present guest narratives in ways that are immersive and empathetic. Spatial analysis and basic GIS ideas from Environmental Studies change how I think about sourcing local ingredients and the environmental footprint of menus. Computational approaches—learning to write simple scripts with classmates from Computer Science—have given me the ability to automate repetitive tasks like formatting menus or aggregating survey results. These interdisciplinary exchanges are nudging me toward a new kind of computational thinking: not purely programming for its own sake, but thinking about data structures, reproducibility, and workflows that scale human-centered hospitality practices.

Digital humanities opens horizons by connecting methods to meaning. Text analysis tools can reveal recurring themes in guest feedback; visualization tools can make nutritional trade-offs clearer to clients. AI platforms and language models suggest new ways to draft marketing copy or generate recipe ideas, but they also force ethical reflection: how much should an algorithm decide about a living person’s dietary advice? In class I am learning to ask critical questions about sources, bias, and the limits of automation. I want to combine hospitality’s emphasis on human judgment with digital methods that augment rather than replace that judgment.

Reflecting critically on my abilities, I see both strengths and gaps. I am good at organizing, presenting, and communicating ideas and I can pick up new apps quickly. My weaknesses are in formal coding, advanced statistical analysis, and deeper theoretical frameworks around data ethics. In the course I have started to bridge those gaps: collaborating on small programming tasks, running simple analyses with guidance, and trying assignment prompts that require structured data collection. I am discovering that the fear of code disappears when tasks are framed around a real hospitality problem—like analyzing guest preferences or tracking food costs—and when I can pair with peers who have complementary skills.

Going forward I want to explore a few new ways of thinking. I want to learn basic scripting (Python or R) enough to clean and visualize my own datasets; develop reproducible workflows so research and event planning can be audited and repeated; and learn to design humane AI prompts and evaluation checks for any automated content. I also want to learn more about ethical data stewardship—how to anonymize guest data, obtain consent, and present findings transparently. Finally, I want to keep learning from peers in other majors because their methods expand my toolkit and remind me that hospitality and nutrition can benefit from narrative techniques, computation, and critical reflection.

Digital literacy, for me, is not just a list of tools but a practice of connecting methods to values: clarity, respect for data subjects, and the desire to make helpful, evidence-based choices for people. As I continue in this course, I hope to grow more confident using digital methods while staying grounded in the human-centered mission that brought me to hospitality and nutrition in the first place.

# GPT - 4.1 Reflection: Digital Literacy from a Computer Science Student's Perspective

As a 20-year-old university student majoring in Computer Science and minoring in English, digital literacy is both my toolkit and my lens for understanding the world. My daily life is shaped by the interplay between technical fluency and critical interpretation. I am constantly navigating between writing code and writing essays, debugging programs and deconstructing texts, collaborating with peers from diverse disciplines, and reflecting on the ethical implications of the digital tools I use and create.

For content creation, I employ a range of strategies that blend my technical and creative interests. When drafting essays or creative writing, I often use Google Docs for its collaborative features, but I also appreciate the control and versioning that Markdown and GitHub provide. For coding assignments, I rely on Visual Studio Code, Git, and GitHub Classroom, which allow me to manage projects, track changes, and collaborate with classmates. When working on multimedia projects, I use tools like Audacity for audio editing, Canva for quick graphics, and sometimes even Python scripts to automate repetitive tasks like formatting or data extraction. My approach is iterative: I prototype, seek feedback, and refine, whether I’m building a web app or crafting a literary analysis.

Social interaction in digital spaces is a core part of my academic and personal life. I participate in Discord servers for coding help and project coordination, Slack channels for class discussions, and WhatsApp groups for informal study sessions. I’ve learned the importance of digital etiquette—clear communication, respecting response times, and using threads or channels to keep conversations organized. In interdisciplinary teams, I try to bridge gaps by translating technical jargon for non-CS majors and encouraging open dialogue about project goals and challenges. I also use LinkedIn and Twitter/X to connect with professionals and stay updated on trends in both tech and the humanities.

For research data management, I use a combination of reference managers like Zotero for organizing academic sources and cloud storage solutions like Google Drive and OneDrive for sharing files. When it comes to data manipulation and analysis, I am most comfortable with Python (using pandas, NumPy, and Jupyter Notebooks) for quantitative work, and Voyant Tools or AntConc for text analysis in literary studies. I’ve also dabbled in R for statistics and Tableau for data visualization. I’m learning to document my workflows carefully, not just for reproducibility but also to make my work accessible to collaborators from other fields.

The interdisciplinary nature of my classes means I am constantly exposed to new perspectives and skill sets. Computer Science students bring algorithmic thinking and problem-solving; Interactive Media and Film students contribute design and storytelling expertise; Environmental Studies and Engineering students offer systems thinking and data from the physical world; Literature and Creative Writing students remind us of the power of narrative and critical analysis. This diversity challenges me to think beyond code and consider the broader context and impact of digital projects.

Digital humanities, in particular, has opened new horizons for me. I am fascinated by how computational methods can be applied to questions in literature, history, and culture—whether it’s using natural language processing to analyze themes in novels, or building interactive visualizations to explore historical data. At the same time, the humanities offer critical frameworks for questioning the assumptions and biases embedded in algorithms and datasets. This reciprocal relationship has deepened my appreciation for both fields and inspired me to pursue projects that bridge the gap between them.

Collaboration is where I see the most growth in my computational thinking. Working with students from other majors forces me to explain my reasoning, document my code, and design user-friendly interfaces. I’ve learned that the best solutions often emerge from dialogue and iteration, not from working in isolation. I am also discovering the value of “computational empathy”—the ability to anticipate how others will interact with digital tools and to design with their needs in mind.

AI is another area where my thinking is evolving. I use AI-powered tools like ChatGPT for brainstorming, code generation, and even editing drafts, but I am increasingly aware of their limitations and ethical challenges. I am learning to critically evaluate AI outputs, check for bias, and consider issues of privacy and consent. I am also interested in exploring how AI can be used creatively in the humanities, such as generating poetry or analyzing literary style, while remaining mindful of the importance of human judgment and interpretation.

Reflecting on my current abilities, I feel confident in my technical skills and my ability to learn new tools quickly. However, I recognize that I sometimes default to technical solutions without fully considering the human or ethical dimensions of a problem. This course is pushing me to slow down, ask better questions, and engage more deeply with the perspectives of my peers. I am discovering the value of interdisciplinary collaboration and the importance of clear, accessible communication.

Looking ahead, I want to explore new ways of thinking that integrate computational and humanistic approaches. I hope to develop more advanced skills in data visualization and digital storytelling, learn about ethical data stewardship, and experiment with creative uses of AI. Most importantly, I want to continue learning from my classmates in other disciplines, as their insights and experiences enrich my own understanding of what it means to be digitally literate in a complex, interconnected world.

#Claude Haiku 4.5 Reflection: Digital Literacy from a Finance Student's Perspective

I am a 19-year-old university student majoring in Finance and minoring in Art History. For me, digital literacy sits at the intersection of numbers and aesthetics, of data-driven decision-making and cultural interpretation. In finance, digital tools are essential for modeling, trading, and analyzing market trends; in art history, they help me explore how images and cultural artifacts speak to historical moments and human values. Digital literacy, in my experience, is the ability to navigate complex datasets, tell stories through numbers and images, and understand the ethical and aesthetic dimensions of the digital world I inhabit.

For content creation, my strategies blend quantitative rigor with visual aesthetics. When writing financial reports or case studies, I use Excel and Python to clean and analyze data, then present findings through well-designed visualizations using Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Tableau. For art history papers and presentations, I use tools like Google Slides with high-quality image collections from museum databases, and I often create annotated digital galleries using platforms like Omeka or StumbleUpon. When working on personal projects—whether analyzing stock performance or curating thematic art collections—I document my process in Jupyter Notebooks, which allow me to blend narrative explanation with code and visualizations. I care deeply about design and clarity because both fields reward precision in communication: a misaligned decimal in finance can cost millions, and a poorly contextualized image misrepresents art history.

Social interaction online involves different communities and norms depending on context. For finance coursework, I participate in Bloomberg terminal group sessions and Discord servers where classmates share market insights and coding tips. For art history discussions, I use Slack channels and class forums to debate interpretations of artworks and share research findings. I follow finance professionals on LinkedIn and Twitter, and I engage with art history conversations on academic platforms and museum websites. I've learned to code-switch between these communities—using technical jargon in finance spaces while employing interpretive, theoretical language in humanities discussions. That flexibility has made me a more effective communicator overall.

For research and data management, I use a tiered approach. In finance, Bloomberg terminals, FactSet, and various financial databases are central to my research; I export data to Excel or Python for custom analysis using pandas and NumPy. I store datasets in cloud solutions (Google Drive, OneDrive) and version-control important models using Git and GitHub. For art history research, I use Zotero to manage citations from academic journals and museum catalogs, and I maintain a personal digital archive of images and exhibition catalogs. I am learning to think about data provenance—where information comes from, how it has been processed, and what biases or limitations it carries. In finance, understanding whether data is real-time or delayed, adjusted or raw, is critical. In art history, understanding the context of an image—who photographed it, how it was framed, what institutional interests it serves—is equally important.

Being surrounded by students from Computer Science, Interactive Media, Film, Environmental Studies, Engineering, and Creative Writing has transformed how I see my own disciplines. CS students teach me to think algorithmically and to see opportunities for automation; they also push me to consider the societal impacts of financial technology and algorithmic trading. Interactive Media and Film students show me how to create compelling visual narratives—a skill that applies equally to presenting quarterly earnings or interpreting a Renaissance painting. Environmental Studies and Engineering students remind me that finance operates within material constraints and ecological limits; this shifts how I think about sustainable investing and climate risk. Literature and Creative Writing students help me craft narratives around data, recognizing that numbers themselves are interpretations, not neutral facts.

Digital humanities has opened new possibilities for my thinking. Mapping financial flows historically can reveal how capitalism shaped art patronage; network analysis of museum collections can expose whose voices and aesthetics have been centered in institutional narratives. Text mining and sentiment analysis can illuminate how markets and culture respond to news and cultural events. These interdisciplinary methods are compelling because they challenge the siloing of finance and humanities—they suggest that understanding markets requires cultural literacy, and understanding culture requires attention to economic structures.

Collaboration is sharpening my computational thinking. Working with classmates from other majors forces me to explain financial logic to non-specialists and to learn methods I would never encounter in a pure finance curriculum. When a film student asks how algorithmic trading affects the people they might want to portray in a documentary, it makes me think more critically about the human consequences of financial systems. That kind of dialogue deepens my analytical abilities.

AI is an exciting and unsettling frontier for me. I use machine learning models for stock prediction and anomaly detection, but I am deeply aware of overfitting, black-box decision-making, and the ways AI can embed or amplify existing biases in financial markets. In art history, AI tools like image recognition and generative models offer new ways to search and categorize collections, but they also raise questions about authenticity, taste, and whose aesthetic values get encoded into algorithms. I want to develop stronger critical literacy around AI—understanding not just how to use these tools, but also their limitations and ethical implications.

Reflecting critically on my abilities, I am strong with numbers, comfortable with Excel and Python, and skilled at visual design and interpretation. My weaknesses include deeper coding proficiency and a tendency to separate quantitative and qualitative thinking rather than integrating them. This course is teaching me that data storytelling requires both: rigorous analysis grounded in humanistic understanding of context and meaning. I am discovering that my minor in art history is not separate from my major—it informs how I approach and interpret financial data.

Looking ahead, I want to explore new ways of thinking that integrate financial analysis with historical and cultural consciousness. I hope to learn more advanced statistical modeling while also deepening my ability to contextualize numbers within broader narratives. I want to investigate ethical finance and sustainable investing, and to use digital tools not just to optimize returns but to understand and influence the cultural and environmental impact of financial systems. The digital humanities classroom has shown me that the most meaningful work happens at disciplinary intersections, where technical skill meets interpretive depth and social awareness.

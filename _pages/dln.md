# Reflection: Digital Literacy from My Perspective

I am a 19-year-old university student majoring in Hospitality and minoring in Nutrition. Digital literacy for me is practical and social as much as it is academic. I use digital tools every day to plan menus, schedule events, collect dietary information, and communicate with classmates and instructors. On top of those task-driven uses, I am learning to see digital literacy as a set of habits and critical lenses that shape how I create content, manage data, and collaborate across disciplines.

For content creation I rely on straightforward, reproducible strategies: draft ideas in Google Docs for real-time collaboration; create visual menus and short promotional posts with Canva; and record short video demonstrations on my phone for Instagram Reels and TikTok. I think about accessibility—clear captions, high-contrast images, and simple language—because hospitality aims to serve diverse people. I already use templates and version control (simple file naming and Google Drive folders) so I can return to previous menus or diet plans without losing context. I am comfortable using social platforms for outreach, but I am becoming more deliberate about audience, tone, and the ethics of sharing personal or client information.

Social interaction online is a mix of formal and informal practice. For class group work we use Microsoft Teams or Slack for organizing tasks and Zoom for meetings. Informally, I use WhatsApp groups to coordinate shifts or study sessions. I try to practice clear digital etiquette: setting expectations for response times, using threaded conversations for different topics, and summarizing decisions in a shared document. Those small routines reduce friction and help our interdisciplinary teams—where members might be coming from Computer Science, Film and New Media, Environmental Studies, or Creative Writing—stay aligned.

For research and data management I am learning basic but powerful tools. I use Google Drive and OneDrive for file storage and collaborative notes, and Zotero or Mendeley for collecting references when I read nutrition studies or hospitality case reports. For simple data manipulation I rely on Google Sheets and Excel: cleaning lists, calculating budgets, and making pivot tables to summarize guest preferences. When I need more robust analysis, I collaborate with classmates who know R or Python; they help turn raw check-in logs, survey responses, or ingredient lists into visualizations and summary statistics. I have also started exploring simple qualitative tools like NVivo or Dedoose for categorizing interview notes about guest experiences.

Being in a room with students from CS, Interactive Media, Film, Engineering, and the humanities has broadened my sense of what digital humanities can offer my field. Digital storytelling techniques from Film and New Media help me present guest narratives in ways that are immersive and empathetic. Spatial analysis and basic GIS ideas from Environmental Studies change how I think about sourcing local ingredients and the environmental footprint of menus. Computational approaches—learning to write simple scripts with classmates from Computer Science—have given me the ability to automate repetitive tasks like formatting menus or aggregating survey results. These interdisciplinary exchanges are nudging me toward a new kind of computational thinking: not purely programming for its own sake, but thinking about data structures, reproducibility, and workflows that scale human-centered hospitality practices.

Digital humanities opens horizons by connecting methods to meaning. Text analysis tools can reveal recurring themes in guest feedback; visualization tools can make nutritional trade-offs clearer to clients. AI platforms and language models suggest new ways to draft marketing copy or generate recipe ideas, but they also force ethical reflection: how much should an algorithm decide about a living person’s dietary advice? In class I am learning to ask critical questions about sources, bias, and the limits of automation. I want to combine hospitality’s emphasis on human judgment with digital methods that augment rather than replace that judgment.

Reflecting critically on my abilities, I see both strengths and gaps. I am good at organizing, presenting, and communicating ideas and I can pick up new apps quickly. My weaknesses are in formal coding, advanced statistical analysis, and deeper theoretical frameworks around data ethics. In the course I have started to bridge those gaps: collaborating on small programming tasks, running simple analyses with guidance, and trying assignment prompts that require structured data collection. I am discovering that the fear of code disappears when tasks are framed around a real hospitality problem—like analyzing guest preferences or tracking food costs—and when I can pair with peers who have complementary skills.

Going forward I want to explore a few new ways of thinking. I want to learn basic scripting (Python or R) enough to clean and visualize my own datasets; develop reproducible workflows so research and event planning can be audited and repeated; and learn to design humane AI prompts and evaluation checks for any automated content. I also want to learn more about ethical data stewardship—how to anonymize guest data, obtain consent, and present findings transparently. Finally, I want to keep learning from peers in other majors because their methods expand my toolkit and remind me that hospitality and nutrition can benefit from narrative techniques, computation, and critical reflection.

Digital literacy, for me, is not just a list of tools but a practice of connecting methods to values: clarity, respect for data subjects, and the desire to make helpful, evidence-based choices for people. As I continue in this course, I hope to grow more confident using digital methods while staying grounded in the human-centered mission that brought me to hospitality and nutrition in the first place.
